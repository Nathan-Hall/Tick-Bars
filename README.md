## Explanation
- Implementation of Tick Bars from "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Del Prado.
- Gets tick data from Binance API and then calculates tick bars, volume bars and dollar bars
- Also implements tick imbalance bars and plots alot of results.
- Did this project for fun as wanted to get familiar with tick data. Gave up on further implementation as from further reading I think there are much better ML books than this one.
